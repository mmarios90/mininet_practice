A simple Spanning Tree (Leaf-Spine) topology of 16 hosts and 20 switched
organised in three layers (1.access-edge layer(s1-18), 2.aggregation layer(s9-s16), and 3.the
core-spine layer(s17-s20). Each switch in access layer connects to two host directly and also is connected with
two switches of aggregation layer as shown below. This complex linking offers multiple alternative routes for each
host and node, to communicate to another one. That topology serves well in cases when a link fails or being overload,
by having the alternative routes.

Because of the ST loops problem in such topologies, before starting this topology, run the pox controller, as follows:

sudo pox/pox.py forwarding.l2_learning openflow.discovery --eat-early-packets openflow.spanning_tree --no-flood --hold-down
